# hello-world

first 

Hello, Juan here. I live in the north coast of Spain, in a city called Santander. In my free time I like to go sailing, ride a biek and swimming. At the moment I am a mechanical engineering student at the university of Southampton.

Just here, adding more stuff to see how it influences the whole project.
